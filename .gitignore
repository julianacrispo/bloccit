# See https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files for more about ignoring files.
#Any file specified in .gitignore will not be pushed to Github when you git push. For that reason, #if there are any files that contain sensitive data, or data that is only relevant to your local #environment, be sure to list them in .gitignore.
#
# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# Ignore bundler config.
/.bundle

# Ignore the default SQLite database.
/db/*.sqlite3
/db/*.sqlite3-journal

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
/log/*.log
/tmp

# Ignore application configuration - Figaro gem installer
/config/application.yml

# Carrierwave image
public/uploads
